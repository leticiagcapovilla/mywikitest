<h2>The Sirius project</h2>
<p>Sirius is a 3 GeV synchrotron light source that is being built by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). The storage ring uses the multi-bend-achromat design approach (5BA in this case) to achieve a very low beam emittance of 0.25 nmÂ·rad. The 518 m circumference contains 20 straight sections of alternating 6.5 and 7.5 meters in length, to be used for insertion devices as well as injection and RF systems. The central dipole of the 5BA cell is a permanent magnet with transverse and longitudinal field gradients to reduce the emittance and provide a hard X-ray radiation source. The thin high field section at its center of approximately 3.2 T provides radiation with critical energy of 19 keV with a modest contribution to the total energy loss. The other low field dipoles (0.56 T), responsible for the main beam deflection, will be electromagnetic. Many challenges are associated with this kind of lattice, including both in beam dynamics and accelerator engineering, that require R&amp;D on new techniques.</p>
<p>The Sirius 5BA lattice design comprises a 5-fold symmetric configuration with alternating high and low horizontal betatron functions that has been optimized in the presence of nonlinear and perturbation effects. Most of the subsystems components are presently either under production or prototyping phase and the Sirius site is already being prepared. The earthwork is concluded and the building construction has started at the end of 2014.</p>
<p>The new machine will be situated in the same LNLS campus, close to the present UVX light source as shown in Figure 1.</p>
