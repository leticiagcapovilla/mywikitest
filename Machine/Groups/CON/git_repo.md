# CON: Git repository

In the next months we will install [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/){target=_blank} on our servers. This will be our default repository for closed source projects and also for open source code drafts.

Installation will be based on [this Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ce/){target=_blank} of GitLab Community Edition.
