# CON: DHCP Servers

## Introduction

This page contains important information about the DHCP server running in our servers as Docker containers. An open-source implementation, [ISC DHCP](https://www.isc.org/downloads/dhcp/){target=_blank}, was chosen.

## Configuration files

A [project repository](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/con-dhcp-settings){target=_blank} is available with some Python scripts to help creating configuration files to be used with the server. Check the [project's README file](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/con-dhcp-settings/blob/master/README.md){target=_blank} to get further details about these scripts.
