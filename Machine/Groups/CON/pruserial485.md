# CON: PRUserial485

<br />
 
## Introduction

|**Figure 1**: PRU-SS, from Texas Instruments|

PRUserial485 is a high-performance RS-485 serial interface developed for the embedded single board computer BeagleBone Black (BBB), an open-hardware platform based on Texas Instruments AM335x SoC. Running a Debian image, BBBs are the main distributed nodes for Sirius Control System.


The PRUserial485, as its name may predict, has been designed to run at one of the two programmable real-time units (PRUs) available at the SoC. They are a dedicated RISC processor, which only executes a binary file at once, with a 200 MHz clock (5 ns instruction time).

<br />

## Motivation and main features

This was the first and largest application for BeagleBone PRU. Reaching data rates up to 15 Mbps, it allows fast transfers of large data amount. Also, Sirius design requires equipment with great stability, reliability and synchronized operation.

For this purpose, the PRUserial485 has been designed mainly for Sirius Power Supplies, which are digitally controlled at 6 Mbps. This interface, which is very deterministic, also includes a timing input for triggering data sending during sync operation, such as booster ramping and soft orbit correction.

The steps below are mandatory to project development and understanding. They will be discussed in the next sections.

* Hardware interface
* BeagleBone pin configuration
* PRU firmware
* Carrier library
* Memory mapping

<br />

### Synchronous operation mode: a particularity

"Sirius power supplies must perform synchronized adjusts during booster ramping, orbit correction, magnets cycling and migration mode. For booster energy ramping, for example, curves with 3920 points must be run at 2 Hz. For that purpose, a PRU serial mode was implemented to deliver serial messages with low jitter to power suppliesâ€™ controllers. Concerning serial network, there are two main sync modes: after a triggering a timing pulse, PRU interface sends through RS-485:

* A broadcast command
* A command addressed to a specific device

When sync mode is enabled, PRU is completely dedicated to receiving timing signals, polling a GPIO.

In the first model, after receiving a timing pulse, serial interface sends a broadcast message to all devices in the line. Final action depends on how the power supply is configured: it
could be a setpoint implementation or start of a magnet cycling, for example. The second one sends a sequence of setpoints each time a timing pulse is received, following ramp curves that user has loaded previously. Ramp curves are stored in DDR memory and they are subdivided into four different groups. A group is composed of four curves of up to 6250 points (4-byte floating points) each.

In this case, it is possible to changes curves on-the-fly by loading them into a different block as well as changing pointer for next point of curve in execution. Also, two more parameters should be configured: execute curve once or multiple times and intercalate normal write/read messages between timing commands or only after the last curve point."

<br />

## Hardware Requirements

|![Pruserial485-sch.png](/img/groups/con/pruserial485/Pruserial485-sch.png)|
|-|
|**Figure 3: **|

The main Controls Group hardware interface designed for BeagleBone Black, [[CON:SERIALxxCON|SERIALxxCON]][link], has all the peripherals that are needed to have the PRUserial485 interface working properly.

PRUserial485 depends on an external UART chip: [MAX3107](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX3107.pdf), from Maxim Integrated. Although it is able to interface with integrated UART subsystem available at BBB SoC, using an external UART has led to FIFO depth increasing and a wide range of programmable baud-rates, reaching up to 15 Mbps. The external UART is digitally controlled with PRU through SPI.

Another important external IC is the line driver. Controls Group uses NVE [IL3685](https://www.nve.com/Downloads/il3685.pdf) as the RS-485 transceiver.

<br />

## Programming Developments

This is the core of this project. It is needed to have, at least, two coding files: one for PRU firmware and other dedicated do ARM core (operating system). As a standalone system, PRU runs a binary file which must be pre-loaded and started by the ARM core.

<br />

### Pin configuration

BeagleBone pins that are connected to P8 and P9 headers can be configured in several modes. Some of them are directly connected to pins that can be driven from PRUs and must be configured before use. For this application and considering SERIALxxCON hardware design and BBB kernel 4.14.x:

<br />

```
 # PRUserial485 pins
 config-pin P8_46 pruin          # SOFT SPI MISO
 config-pin P8_39 pruin          # IRQ FROM MAX3107
 config-pin P8_27 pruin          # SYNC TIMING INPUT
 config-pin P8_45 pruout         # SOFT SPI CLK
 config-pin P8_43 pruout         # SOFT SPI CS
 config-pin P8_41 pruout         # SOFT SPI MOSI
```

In project folder, there is a bash script that configures pins automatically. It must be run before any application that uses PRUserial485.

<br />

### Operation Modes

#### Conventional Mode

Once serial interface is started, it is needed to have it configured. As it is a full-duplex RS-485 standard communication, BeagleBone can have a role either as a **master** or as a **slave** in the network. This parameter, along with desired baudrate, is passed when it is started.

The master is the main device in the network. It is the master who will always request for information and get the reply.
The slave will only send data into the serial network if it is requested to do so. Receiving any incoming message, it will only reply if the message is addressed to it.

For both cases, there are ''write'' and ''read'' commands to send/get data to/from data line.

 <br />

#### Synchronized configuration

|**Figure 4**:|

<br />

### PRU Firmware

PRU firmware can be written either in C or assembly language. Texas Instruments provides compilers for both programming languages. In the case it is intended to have high performance and determinism, assembly language will be used in order to write PRU firmware. Few instructions are used, however, a good knowledge of the processor architecture is important.

PRU is the core which will be controlling the external UART (MAX3107).

<br />

### ARM/Linux Libraries

Texas Instruments also provides a library for dealing with PRUs in system level. It is called "libprussdrv" and can be easily installed through ''apt-get install''. Using this library it is possible to load binary files into PRU, get/send signals to it, check/open memory mapping, etc. 

Communication between PRU and Operating System is usually performed through memory access (either reading or writing to special registers). For that purpose, it has been developed a library for this project in C and a Python module (that comes from the C library) for interchanging information to/from PRU. Both are installed on the system, being available at the default directory (it is not necessary to carry along .h or .py files when coding).

<br />

### Source Codes

Sources of PRU software (written in assembly language) and the corresponding system library for Linux (written in C) can be obtained from [PRUserial485 Github repository](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/pru-serial485){target=_blank}.

<br />

## Detailed Description

In this section, code development will be detailed. As discussed above, PRU and ARM share data through memory mapping. Specifically, there is a dedicated 12-kbyte shared RAM memory for this purpose and it will be used. Aditionally, it has been extended to DDR memory, in order to increase mapping size (developed for Power Supplies' synchronous operation through BBB).

<br />

### AM335x Memory Mapping

Memory mapping is a very important feature for this application. It is through these memory spaces that data will be shared between PRU system and main Linux core.

First, and more directly, comes the shared RAM. A PRU-dedicated, it is reserved to application that use real-time cores. This will be used to exchange configuration, control and serial data bytes.

Also, there is the possibility of reserving a larger region of the external DDR memory and use it with PRU sub-systems. It comes to be useful when it is intended to store many long curve points and share them with PRU to perform synchronized adjustments. It will be discussed in the next sub-sections.

|**Figure 5**:|

<br />

#### Shared RAM Memory

It is a 12kbyte RAM, embedded on the SoC, shared with main core and both PRUs. For PRUserial485 application, memory mapping follows the sequence below:

| Offset| Description |
| --- | --- |
|00| MAX3107 version (0x1A) |
|01| Data status (0x00: Data ready for reading / 0x55: Old data on buffer / 0xFF: Data ready for sending) |
|02| Serial baudrate (MAX3107 BRGCONFIG register) |
|03| Serial baudrate (MAX3107 DIVLSB register) |
|04| Serial baudrate (MAX3107 DIVMSB register) |
|05| Sync operation control (0x00: Stop / 0xFF: Start) |
|06..09| Timeout to wait for a reply after a writing cycle (x10 ns) |
|10..13| Curve execution: pointer for next curve point |
|15..18| Curve execution: absolute address of memory block at DDR memory (curve points storage) |
|20..23| Curve execution: total size, in bytes, of all four curves |
|24| Board hardware address (SERIALxxCON = 21) |
|25| Master or Slave operation ("M" or "S") |
|26..28| One serial byte length (ns) |
|29..31| Delay to wait between a sync and normal command (x10 ns) |
|32| Serial receiving timeout (MAX3107 RXTIMEOUT register) |
|50| Sync operation: command size |
|51..| Sync operation: command |
|80..83| Sync operation: receiving pulse counting |
|84| Sync operation: sync ok (0x00: not waiting for pulse / 0xFF: waiting for pulse triggering) |
|85| Sync operation: mode (0x51 Single curve sequence & Intercalated read messages / 0x5E Single curve sequence & Read messages at End of curve / 0xC1 Continuous curve sequence & Intercalated read messages / 0xCE Continuous curve sequence & Read messages at End of curve / 0x5B Single Sequence - Single Broadcast Function command) |
|100..103| Sending data: vector size |
|104..5999| Sending data: data |
|6000..6003| Incoming data: vector size |
|6004..11999| Incoming data: data  |

<br />

#### DDR Memory

While enabling PRU kernel module, an argument is needed to reserve a piece of DDR external memory (in this case, 0x200000 bytes will be reserved)

` $ modprobe uio_pruss extram_pool_sz=0x200000`

Once this is performed, a system file will be created, indicating starting address and size for reserved region. They are located at

`/sys/class/uio/uio0/maps/map1/addr`
`/sys/class/uio/uio0/maps/map1/size`

<br />

As a project definition, it has been set to have:

 1. Four independent blocks (named 0 to 3)
 2. Each block will store four curves, one for each power supply (total: 16 curves)
 3. Each curve can have up to 6250 points (floating values, ie, 25000 bytes)

<br />

Here, dealing with up to four curves is justified that Power Supplies can be allocated in crate with up to four of them in the same crate (FBP model) and there is a BSMP command that adjusts all their currents at once.

Inside DDR memory, data is allocated according to the table below.

### PRU Firmware

PRU is an assembly-based firmware for this application, once performance must be considered as well as jitter and determinism. This section discuss the code itself and strategies of implementation.

<br />

#### Files and compiling

Source files for PRUserial485:

`PRUserial485.p`
`PRUserial485.hp`

Texas Instruments provides a compiler (pasm) for PRU devices. As a standard, Controls Group stores its binary files into /usr/bin folder. For compiling code and generating a binary PRUserial485.bin:
 
`pasm -V3 -b PRUserial485.p`
`mv PRUserial485.bin /usr/bin`

*-V for PRU core version number. V3 for PRUSSv2 (latest)*

*-b for little endian binary file*

<br />

#### Code Structure

***Initialization***

|**Figure 6**: |

<br />

### ARM/Linux Libraries

ARM/Linux library is coded in C language and a Python module is constructed using `Python.h` C library. This library is a bridge between userspace and PRU functionalities. It is used to pre-configure serial interface, to share data, select operation mode and verify PRU status.

<br />

####  Initialization 

It is **mandatory** to initialize the interface before using it. For that purpose, there is a function available. PRUs and its interrupts are initialized, shared memory is mapped and some configuration (baudrate, master/slave mode, counting registers, etc) are set on memory before executing PRU binary.

As explained on PRU section, there is a circular buffer for incoming data. At ARM level, the circular buffer depth is pre-configured to 100 kB (it can be increased, but it is enough for regular applications, so far).

When invoking init function, an independent thread is launched (which is killed when closing the interface). The task performed by this thread is copying data from shared memory to a larger buffer on ARM environment as soon as it is available. This buffer is accessed by this thread an also by the function which gets PRU data (PRUserial485_read). A semaphore is implemented in this case.

|![PRU-thread.PNG](/img/groups/con/pruserial485/PRU-thread.PNG)|
|-|
|**Figure 7**: |

The functions available can be divided into three main cathegories, which will be described further:

* **General purpose:** includes basic write and read functions and also special functions to open and close the serial port
* **Curves:** dedicated for loading and manipulating curves when operating in sync mode.
* **Sync operation:** commands designed to operate the interface when sync operation is required.

<br />

####  Compiling and installing the library 

For compiling the library into your BeagleBone Black, clone the repository into it. There is a bash script that user can run to have all files correctly compiled and installed on the system (along with PRU firmware). Steps to install it are listed below:

<br />

```
# Compiling and installing C library

##  Intrinsic timing constraints 

Software delays are real and in the case of high performance applications, they must be considered. For library version 1.3.3, some of them were quantified, as shown below:

<br />

**Sync Mode - PRU level**

* Lattency of sync message regarding sync pulse 
  * Broadcast command: 1.02 Î¼s
  * Curve setpoint command: 2.12 Î¼s
* Sync message jitter: 13.45 ns
* Returning to waiting for next pulse, after sending a
  * Sync message: 3.1 Î¼s
  * Normal message, without waiting for its answer: 4 Î¼s
  * Normal message, receive the answer immediately (no response delay) and store its 64 bytes: 48 Î¼s

<br />

**Sync Mode - Processor level**

* Load curve into memory: '''29 ms'''
* Start sync mode: '''14 Î¼s'''
* Close sync mode and recover normal operation: '''517 Î¼s'''

<br />

**Normal Mode - Processor level**

* Initialize PRUserial485: '''1.4 ms'''
* Complete message sending, without waiting for an answer
  * 5-byte message: 50 Î¼s
  * 50-byte message: 165 Î¼s
  * 100-byte message: 250 Î¼s
* Complete message sending, receiving the answer immediately (no response delay) and store its 64 bytes:
  * 5-byte message: 120 Î¼s
  * 50-byte message: 215 Î¼s
  * 100-byte message: 305 Î¼s
