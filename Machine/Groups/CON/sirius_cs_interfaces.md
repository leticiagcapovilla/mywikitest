# CON: Sirius control system interfaces

<br>

## Introduction

This page contains listings of control hardware and its interfaces to Sirius control system, from a point of view of the integration tasks assigned to [LNLS Controls Group](/Machine/Groups/CON).

<br>

## Beam diagnostics and feedback

Beam diagnostics and feedback systems are under responsibility of [[DIG:DIG|LNLS Beam Diagnostics Group]]. All devices associated with these systems will be plugged into the control system through an Ethernet interface. EPICS IOCs will run on dedicated rackmount computers. In the future, this section will contain documentation about all beam diagnostics and feedback devices, network points and IOCs.

<br>

## Interlock system

[[IMA:IMA|LNLS Magnets group]](link) is developing an interlock system for Sirius based on Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Default communication interface for interlock modules will be 100 Mbps Ethernet, under a device-level ring (DLR) topology. With this topology, the interlock system will interface to the [[CON:Sirius_control_system_network|control system network]] using a few Ethernet ports.

We intend to design an EPICS interface for the interlock system using [EtherIP](http://ics-web.sns.ornl.gov/kasemir/etherip/){target=_blank}.

This section will be updated soon with details about the network connections and supervisory software of the interlock system.

<br>

## Linac

Sirius Linac will be supplied by the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP). As a turnkey solution, it has its own control system (based on EPICS), with client computers, operator interfaces and an archiving software, among others.

Installation of Linac is scheduled to early 2018. After its assembly at the new building, we will plug its control system to [Sirius control system network](/Machine/Groups/CON/counting_system) and develop some integration with other [control system](/Machine/control_system) applications.

<br>

## Power supplies

Sirius power supplies are under development by [ELP:ELP|LNLS Power Electronics Group (ELP)](link). [Controls Group](/Machine/Groups/CON) is responsible for integrating them to the control system.

Remote operation of power supplies is possible through a serial interface (RS-485). Communication protocol for this interface is [Basic Small Messages Protocol (BSMP)](/Machine/Groups/CON/bsmp).

There will be seven different models of power supplies in Sirius. Tables below show an old specification of BSMP entities of power supplies. As this specification is being modified, in a few weeks this section will be updated.

Translation of BSMP entities into EPICS process variables will be performed by an application running at a BeagleBone Black SBC. This application will handle BSMP entities in an adequate manner, depending on what type of power supply is being managed.

## Pulsed magnets

Current prototype of Sirius pulsed magnets controller unit has inside it a [[CON:PUC|PUC]](link) stack, with one analog and one digital interfaces. We intend to communicate to all controller units of the pulsed magnets with one BeagleBone Black, through a RS-485 serial network.

In Sirius, there will be ten controller units for pulsed magnets, distributed over six racks. Two extra controller units will be kept as a backup.

**Table 4**: Sirius pulsed magnets controller units 

|Rack| Pulsed magnet| Number of magnets |
|-|-|-|
|1| Booster injection septum| 1 |
|2| Booster injection kicker| 1 |
|3| Booster extraction kicker| 1 |
|4| Booster extraction septum| 2 |
|5| Storage ring injection thick septum| 2 |
|Storage ring injection thin septum| 1 |
|6| "On-axis" injection kicker| 1 |
|Pulsed multipole magnet| 1  |


Here, [[CON:PUC|PUC]](link)'s analog output signal is used as the reference for a Glassman high voltage power supply. Output level of the same power supply is read with [[CON:PUC|PUC]](link)'s analog input. Digital interface pins works as general-purpose inputs/outputs for remote operation of the controller unit:


**Table 5**: PUC input digital pins for pulsed magnets controller unit 

|Bit| Description |
|-|-|
|0| Thyratron fan status |
|1| Interlock |
|2| Personnel safety (door is open) |
|3| Temperature |
|4| Thyratron filament supply |
|5| Thyratron reservoir supply |
|6| High voltage supply overcurrent |
|7| Mode of operation (local/remote)  |


**Table 6**: PUC input digital pins for pulsed magnets controller unit 

|Bit| Description |
|-|-|
|0| Turn on/off the high voltage power supply |
|1| Turn on/off thyratron filament supply |
|2| Turn on/off thyratron trigger |
|3| Stand by/normal |
|4| Reset  |


We will start to perform tests with a prototype of the pulsed magnets controller unit soon. In order to interface it to EPICS, a server application named [Sirius-CAS-PM](http://git.cnpem.br/eduardo.coelho/sirius-cas-pm){target=_blank} was developed in Python with [pcaspy](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/pcaspy){target=_blank}. It serves four process variables (PVs), each of them related to one of the analog/digital inputs or outputs of the [[CON:PUC|PUC]](link) inside the controller unit:

`PM:PUC:AnalogInput`
`PM:PUC:AnalogOutput`
`PM:PUC:DigitalInput`
`PM:PUC:DigitalOutput`

These PV names are provisory. Proper names will be defined later, and other PVs may also be added to the software already written.

[Sirius-CAS-PM](http://git.cnpem.br/eduardo.coelho/sirius-cas-pm){target=_blank} was created under an effort of evaluating [pcaspy](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/pcaspy){target=_blank} as a reliable and easy-to-use tool for creating EPICS server applications. Overall, we are very satisfied with this Python module capabilities.

## RF system

[Controls Group](/Machine/Groups/CON) is working on the integration of these RF devices into the control system:

* RF power amplifiers designed by our [[RF:RF|Radiofrequency Group]](link);
* Low-level radiofrequency (LLRF) systems;
* PLCs (the same Allen-Bradley used on the interlock system).

<br>

## Vacuum systems

By now, we are working on EPICS interfaces for two equipments of Sirius vacuum systems. They are:

* Agilent 4UHV Ion Pump Controller;
* MKS 937B Digital Combination Vacuum Gauge Controller.

Communication interface of these devices is serial RS-232/RS-485. We are considering to adopt RS-485, so this way we can control several equipments with a single serial interface. But we still have to evaluate if this is the best approach, since communication baud rates are slow and maybe it is not a good idea to share the same interface between various devices.

Moreover, Sirius vacuum systems will have about 480 temperature measurements. For them, data acquisition hardware is a combination of [MBTemp](/Machine/Groups/CON/mbtemp) boards with Pt100 sensors.

The EPICS interface for controlling all vacuum devices is [CON:Stream-IOC|Stream-IOC](link).
