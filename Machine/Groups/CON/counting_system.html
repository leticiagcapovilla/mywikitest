<h2 class="toc-header" id="introduction"> Introduction</h2>
<p><a class="is-asset-link" href="/Machine/Groups/CON.md">LNLS Controls Group</a> has designed a simple hardware solution for counting trains of pulses during a pre-defined time base. Based on Beaglebone's PRU (''Processing Real-Time Unit''), the system was first designed in order to compute data from commercial Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs) and in-house Gamma Sensors that will be installed in Sirius.</p>
<p>The current version is capable of counting pulses from up to 8 channels and can achieve the maximum rate of 14.29MHz. The main connection to Control System Network is through an Ethernet Port, where it will also get power from Power over Ethernet (PoE) standard (IEEE 802.3af).</p>

<p>The hardware is based on Beaglebone's PRU, which will count received pulses and make the counting available to main processor. To make it, some stages are necessary and them are showed on diagram beside:<br>
When the Ethernet data cable entry on board, the first step is divide both electrical circuit and data, made at Power Supply Stage. In it, the circuit's power supply is provided by a Power Over Ethernet (POE) module that allows the electrical current needed for circuit operation to be carried over the Ethernet data cables, minimizing the number of cables required for hardware operations, without compromise the exchange of information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are two types of interface connectors, which will be connected to the external pulsed sensors (detailed in next sections). Inside CountingPRU board, the inputs coming from sensors will be conditioned to +3.3V (BBB compatible) and will trigger the pulse detectors. Once the pulse is read by the respective PRU, the PRU will reset the pulse detector.</p>

<p>The POE used in this version is the Ag9205-S, produced by Silvertel and has 5V output and maximun 13W of power output. This board is also resposible for powering the BLMs and Gamma Sensors with +5V, -5V and +24V. These values are obtained using DC/DC converters: VIBLSD1-S5-S5-DIP and MEV1D0512DC.</p>
<p>Initially, both Rx (3, 6) and Tx (1,2) pins, come from RJ-45 connector, are connected on a POE XFRMR module, a Gigabit Ethernet Transformer POE, which provides the output Tx+, Tx-, Rx+ and Rx- to another RJ-45 connector, that will connet on the BeagleBone Black. The another pins of input connector and centertaps of the XFRMR module are connected in two diode bridges, that provide input voltage for the Ag9205 (Vin+ and Vin-), like figure 02.</p>
<p>After that, the silvertel’s output is connected on two DC/DC converters, already mentioned, which will convert the output to -5V and 24V. The first DC/DC (VIBLSD1-S5-S5-DIP) is a 5V/5V converter, its +VOUT output has been grounded, changing the pin from 0V to -5V. The  MEV1D0512DC converter is a DC/DC that provides -12V and +12V in its output. To get +24V of its, the output -12V also has been grounded, changing the +12V pin to +24V.</p>
<p>On both converters has been connected an output load, because to operate them efficiently and reliably is necessary an minimum output load which must not be less than 10% of maximum load (1W on both). If the actual load is less than the specified minimum load, the output ripple may increase sharply while its efficiency and reliability will reduce greatly (See figure 03).</p>
<p>Board typical power consumption: '''3.3 W''' (total) [[ A CONFIRMAR ]]</p>

<p>The Ag9205-S module has two configures possible, the power and the output voltage. For this, resistors are connected between CP and ADJ pins and in/outputs. The maximum output Power can be adjusted from 3.84 W to 12.95 W and the output voltage, from 4.5V to 5.65V. Each configuration can be seen on datasheet of module.</p>
<p>As 13W and 5V outputs are default values, both CP and ADJ pins haven’t been connected. As the minimum ouput power needs to be confugured, was added output load  on Silvertel Ag9205. In this configuration, the minimum power is 0.44W, therefore, the value of output load is 50Ω. The final circuit of Ag9205 can be seen on figure 04.</p>

<p>The commercial BLM (Beam Loss Monitor) is produced by Bergoz Instrumentation and is based on two photodiodes that emit photons when a charged particle passes through them.</p>
<p>At CountingPRU, the BLM’s inputs are a double RJ-45 connector which are connected on a transformer, once that the monitor has a differential output of ±2,5V, but this signals are generate by a transformer on Bergoz’s BLM without center tap, resulting in a signal with offset. To solve this, the input differential signal was converted in a single  ended signal -  grounding one pin of transformer - with double of initial voltage. (See figure 05).<br>
After that, the pulse switch a transistor that generates a pulse down in its collector, this pulse is inverted by a logic NOT  gate, and the result can be seen at figure 06.</p>
<p>The output signal of the logic gate is sended to a Flip-Flop D and used as clock. The objetive is to obtain a pulse with voltage compatible with BeagleBone (+3,3 V) and change it to a square wave, which will be send to BBB.</p>
<h4 class="toc-header" id="calibration-of-blms"> <em><strong>Calibration of BLMs</strong></em></h4>
<p>BLM circuits are calibrated ex-factory for a spurious count rate of 10 kHz ±800 Hz. To make it, is necessary apply a voltage of +5V via a 4.7kΩ resistor to  pin ‘Enable/Disable’ of each photodiode and adjust the referent potentiometer till 9.6~10.4 kHz output. The counter has two electronic switches to this purpose, switching 5V through a resistor on each ‘Enable/Disable’ pin, controlled by four BeagleBone pins (C13, C14, C15, C16 all of them on the P9 pin bus).</p>

<p>On top of that, the CountingPRU also has inputs to up six gamma sensors developed in-house. The pulses coming from gamma detectors are +5V signals, therefore, after connector, the pulses switching a Flip-Flop D.<br>
The use of FF is to change gamma detectors pulses to a square wave, change its voltage to 3,3V (compatible with BeagleBone) and protect the BBB inputs from high level voltage pulses. The figure 07 show how is the input circuit.<br>
A resistor was also added to the Flip-Flop clock pin to increase the input impedance of the FF and pins of BeagleBone Black are connected on pins of both FF and buffer, to controlling them.</p>

<p>One of the programs belonging to the "BBB-functions" have the finality of defining the IPs of the counters board. This program are responsible for setting its ip to dhcp, automatically.<br>
It is executed only on boot of BeagleBone, if a Counter Board is identified by it.</p>
<h4 class="toc-header" id="to-dhcp-ip"> To dhcp IP</h4>
<p>The program responsible to define the internet protocol address of counters to dynamic ip is the "key_dhcp.py". When BeagleBone is started, the inputs pins of the gamma monitors are analyzed, if them are in a specific sequence, the counter's ip is changed.<br>
The sequence required to change ip is "101010", obtained by connecting an external monostable oscillator hardware that will trigger the FF of each input.</p>
<p>If the ip has changed to dhcp, the panel led will blink quickly, wait for the stop and the board will be ready.</p>
