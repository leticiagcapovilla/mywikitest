# CON: EPICS training for operators and users

Between September and November 2016, Controls Group (CON) offered a first course on EPICS for some members of LNLS staff. The target audience was operators and users in general. Below is a list of topics covered:

- EPICS overview;
- EPICS Base and some of its command-line utilities;
- Channel Access PV Gateway;
- pyepics Python module;
- Control System Studio;
- The EPICS Archiver Appliance;
- The Best Ever Alarm System Toolkit (BEAST).

EPICS was chosen as the default platform for [Sirius Control System](/Machine/control_system) applications. With the purpose of training machine operators and other LNLS members, new course offerings are planned for 2018. Then additional topics may be discussed, such as:

- EDM (Extensible Display Manager);
- Olog (logbook service for accelerator operations);
- MATLAB as an EPICS client.
- LabVIEW as an EPICS client.
- Java as an EPICS client.

In the future, we hope to improve this page, writing didactic texts or producing some videos.
