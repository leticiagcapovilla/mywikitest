<h1>TIMBO INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Orion is a complex of laboratories for research into pathogens nestled in approximately 30,000 m<sup>2</sup>, which foresees installations of maximum biological containment (biosafety level 4 â€“ BSL4) in Latin America and will be connected to the Brazilian synchrotron light source, SIRIUS. This infrastructure will also feature biosafety levels 2 (BSL2) and 3 (BSL3) spaces encompassing basic research laboratories and advanced skills in electron microscopy. Consequently, the Orion project will be dedicated to advancing knowledge of pathogens and related diseases and may also support surveillance actions and public health policies. It is expected that Orion can contribute to the development of diagnostic methods, vaccines, treatments and epidemiological strategies, thus strengthening the Brazilian health system. Orion will be located in the National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM), a social organization supervised by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI).</p>
