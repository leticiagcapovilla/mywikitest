# FAC: Log

* 2015-10-30

    * update Sirius wiki with fieldmap analysis of Q14,Q20,Q30 and BC_model5
    * generate AT survey of SI.V13 and compare it with AutoCAD drawing
        * generalize lnls_build_ref_orbit to accept both an origin and a rotation angle
        * rotation of the storage ring is such that the injection straight line makes a 23 degree angle with the EAST-EST line.

    * running dynapt calcs for SI.V13 (after nominal quadrupole models with systematic multipoles)
    * running dynapt calcs for SI.V13 (before nominal quadrupole models with systematic multipoles)

* 2015-10-28

    * We will optimize SI.V13 with MOGA
    * finalize implementation of the AT model for TS.V02 (initial version at lnls82)
    * run dynamical aperture calculations for new BO.V02B model

* 2015-10-27

    * Reduce number of significant digits in lengths for all lattice models (XRR)
    * SI injection study (go back to it) (XRR)
    * Update TS lattice model with segmented dipole model (XRR)

* 2015-10-26

    * File sirius_si_multipole_systematic_errors.m has to be updated with lastest Q14, Q20 and Q30 models. (XRR)
