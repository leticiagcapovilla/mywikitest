# FAC: Girder Possibilities

### Introduction

We have performed a study where several possible girder configurations have been considered and analyzed. In this study amplification factors are defined and calculated, serving as a way to quickly estimate the statistical effects of misalignment errors on the beam optics. Amplification factors are calculated for free and corrected beam oscillations in the Sirius storage ring

### Girders

In this section are presented several "possible" girder configurations for Sirius. They are compared amongst themselves through their orbit and optics amplification factors (AF) for horizontal and vertical misalignment. The calculations were made assuming perfect correlation between elements in the same girder and zero correlation among girders. 

Table 1 shows an scheme which defines the several configurations tested in the simulations. Figures XX XX XX show orbit and optic amplification factors for misalignment errors of each configuration. The amplification factor of each configuration was calculated from the AF of the girders assuming equal specifications for misalignment for all the girders:

$\left\langle\left\langle x^2(s)\right\rangle_E\right\rangle_s = \sum_i G_i^2\sigma_{\delta}^2 = \sigma_{\delta}^2 K^2,\quad \text{with}\quad K = \sqrt{\sum_i G_i^2}$

where $G_i$ is the amplification factor of the girder $i$.
